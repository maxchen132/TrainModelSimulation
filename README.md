# TrainModelSimulation

## About This Project
Collection of files for CERIAS Research Project for developing a train simulation model and a corresponding Modelica Digital Twin.

## Usage
Note that the .mo files for TrainP3, the current working model, must use Modelica MSL libraries of version 3.4.3. To do this, uncheck the "Load latest Modelica version on startup" and add the Modelica library of version 3.2.3+maint.om.
